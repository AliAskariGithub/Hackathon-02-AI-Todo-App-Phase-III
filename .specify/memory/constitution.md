# Full-Stack Multi-User Todo Web Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### Agentic Autonomy
All code must be generated by Claude Code via the Spec-Kit Plus workflow. No manual code edits are permitted during the development process.

### Live Documentation
Use Context7 MCP Server for all real-time documentation fetches regarding Next.js 16.1.2, Better Auth, and FastAPI. This ensures accurate, up-to-date technical information.

### Secure by Default
Authentication and user isolation (ownership enforcement) are non-negotiable architectural requirements. All user data must be properly isolated and protected.

### Modernity
Leverage the latest features of Next.js 16 (App Router) and Shadcn UI. The application must utilize modern development practices and current technology standards.

## Key Standards

### Tech Stack Compliance
Use the specified technology stack: Next.js 16.1.2, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon Serverless PostgreSQL, and Better Auth. Deviations require explicit architectural approval.

### Auth Protocol
Implement Better Auth JWT Plugin with shared `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` for cross-service verification. Authentication must be consistent across all services.

### API Design Standards
Design RESTful endpoints with strict user-id path parameter validation and JWT middleware filtering. All API endpoints must follow consistent design patterns.

### UI/UX Standards
Implement responsive design using Shadcn UI components with a mobile-first approach. The user interface must be accessible and intuitive across all device sizes.

### Data Integrity Requirements
Maintain database transactions via SQLModel with Neon-specific connection pooling for serverless environments. All data operations must preserve integrity.

## Constraints

### Version Control Policy
Next.js version must be pinned to 16.1.2. All dependencies must be version-locked to prevent unexpected breaking changes during development.

### Security Enforcement
All API requests must return 401 Unauthorized if a valid JWT is missing. Security measures must be implemented at every layer of the application.

### Architecture Boundaries
Frontend and Backend must remain separate services communicating over HTTPS/REST. Service boundaries must be maintained to ensure proper separation of concerns.

### Environment Management
Secrets must be managed via .env files (BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, DATABASE_URL). No hardcoded credentials or secrets are allowed in the codebase.

## Success Criteria

### Authentication Functionality
Users can sign up and sign in via Better Auth. The authentication system must be reliable and secure.

### User Data Isolation
Users can only see, create, and modify their own tasks (enforced via JWT & User ID). Data isolation must be enforced at the API and database levels.

### Cross-Device Compatibility
Application is fully functional on both desktop and mobile views. Responsive design must provide optimal user experience across all devices.

### Agentic Development Compliance
Achieve 0 manual lines of code written by the developer; all changes logged via agentic tasks. The entire development process must follow the agentic workflow.

## Governance

All development activities must comply with the principles outlined in this constitution. Any deviations require explicit architectural approval and documentation. Code reviews must verify adherence to all constitutional principles. The constitution serves as the authoritative source for development standards and practices.
